           <p> With Everafter, your guests are incentivised to share their photos at your event in real time. Not only can they effortlessly upload high-resolution
              images directly to a private, secure platform that you control, but they get a dopamine hit when they see their photo up on the big screen.</p>
 
              <p>No more sifting through social media tags or waiting for that one friend to send their photos 'when they get a chance.' With a few
           clicks, these cherished images are displayed elegantly on any big screen during the event, creating a dynamic, real-time photo gallery everyone can enjoy.</p>
 
           <p>The great thing about Everafter is how easily your guests will be able to start uploading. No hashtags, no tagging events or specific people and no installing apps. 
             Everyone has a web browser on their phone and that's all your guests need to use Everafter. Simple. </p>
 
           <p> And when the event wraps up? You, the host, can easily download all these images in a single zip file, retaining the original quality.
          No watermarks, no data mining, and no third-party interference. Just pure, unadulterated memories, ready for you to relive, share, or
           archive. Everafter is more than a photo-sharing app; it's your key to owning your event's visual legacy.</p>
