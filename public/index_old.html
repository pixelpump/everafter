    <h3>Shared, Saved & Cherished</h3>
    <div class="heroexplainer">
    <p>Everafter is a service born from the realization that leaving
         precious moments in the control of social media companies is a mistake.
          You should have complete control of all of the images shared at your event. That's why we created Everafter.</p>
          <p> Everafter allows your guests to easily upload images taken at your event and share them with both the big screen
             and the bride (or whomever is putting on the event). No fuss, and definitely no muss. No special apps, no
              hashtagging. Just a simple link to the event upload page. </p>
              <p>At the end of the day, all of the uploaded images are in a safe place (not scattered around multiple social media apps)
                 and best of all, in their full glorious resolution, not squished or squared or compressed.
            <p>Click one simple download link and you have all of the images shared that day. Awesome. That's Everafter. </p>

    <p>The cost is a simple $35 USD. </p>
