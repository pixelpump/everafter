       <p> When hosting an event, be it a wedding, corporate gathering, or milestone celebration it's the laughter and the unguarded moments that create the
        most potent memories and of course you want to capture that. Your guests are now all carrying amazing cameras in the shape of phones that would leave a profesional
        photographer of just a few years ago in awe. But sadly these precious photos end up scattered across social media, in varying resolutions and compltely 
        out of your control. Enter Everafter — a groundbreaking web application designed to put you back in charge of your event's photo narrative.</p>

          <p> With Everafter, your guests are incentivised to share their photos at the event in real time. Not only can they effortlessly upload high-resolution
             images directly to a private, secure platform that you control, but they get a dopamine hit when they see it up on the big screen.</p>

             <p>No more sifting through social media tags or waiting for that one friend to send their photos 'when they get a chance.' With a few
          clicks, these cherished images are displayed elegantly on any big screen during the event, creating a dynamic, real-time photo gallery everyone can enjoy.</p>

          <p>The great thing about Everafter is how easily your guests will be able to start uploading. No hashtags, no tagging events or specific people and no installing apps. 
            Everyone has a web browser on their phone and that's all your guests need to use Everafter. Simple. </p>

          <p> And when the event wraps up? You, the host, can easily download all these images in a single zip file, retaining the original quality.
         No watermarks, no data mining, and no third-party interference. Just pure, unadulterated memories, ready for you to relive, share, or
          archive. Everafter is more than a photo-sharing app; it's your key to owning your event's visual legacy.</p>
